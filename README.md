# Biocompatibility-yyc-codec
This is part of my undergraduate research project on a DNA storage model in Bacillus subtilis. This codec is based on the YING YANG codec developed by the BGI Research team ( https://github.com/ntpz870817/DNA-storage-YYC ). Here I will make some adaptations with the aim of improving the codec for in vivo archival.
