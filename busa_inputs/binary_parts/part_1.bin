ght all my life with Captain Quarterblad, and he fights all his life with Throaty,
and all he wants from me is that I give up stalking. But how can I give up stalking
when I have a family to feed? Get a job? I don’t want to work for you, your work
makes me puke, do you understand? This is the way I figure it: if a man works
with you, he is always working for one of you, he is a slave and nothing else. And
I always wanted to be myself, on my own, so that I could spit at you all, at your
boredom and despair.
He finished the dregs of the brandy and threw the empty flask to the ground
with all his might. The flask bounced, flashing in the sun, and rolled away. He
forgot about it immediately. He sat there, covering his eyes with his hands, and he
was trying -- not to understand, not to think, but merely to see something of how
things should be, but all he saw were the faces, faces, faces, and more faces... and
greenbacks, bottles, bundles of rags that were once people, and columns of figures.
He knew that it all had to be destroyed, and he wanted to destroy it, but he guessed
that if it all disappeared there would be nothing left but the flat, bare earth. His
frustration and despair made him want to lean back against the ball. He got up,
automatically brushed off his pants, and started down into the quarry.
The sun was broiling hot, red spots floated before his eyes, the air was quivering
on the floor of the quarry, and in the shimmer it seemed that the ball was dancing
in place like a buoy on the waves. He went past the bucket, superstitiously picking
up his feet higher and making sure not to step on the splotches. And then, sinking
into the rubble, he dragged himself across the quarry to the dancing, winking ball.
He was covered with sweat and panting from the heat, and at the same time, a chill
was running through him, he was shuddering, as if he had a bad hangover, and the
sweet chalk dust gritted between his teeth. He had stopped trying to think. He just
repeated his litany over and over: "I am an animal, you see that. I don’t have the
words, they didn’t teach me the words. I don’t know how to think, the bastards
didn’t let me learn how to think. But if you really are...all-powerful...all-knowing...
then you figure it out! Look into my heart. I know that everything you need is in
there. It has to be. I never sold my soul to anyone! It’s mine, it’s human! You take
from me what it is I want... it just can’t be that I would want something bad! Damn
it all, I can’t think of anything, except those words of his... ’HAPPINESS FOR
EVERYBODY, FREE, AND NO ONE WILL GO AWAY UNSATISFIED!’ "
