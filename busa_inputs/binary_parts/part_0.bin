Arthur jumped up, tore open all the zippers on his jacket, took it off, and threw it
down smack at his feet, raising a cloud of white dust. He was shouting something,
making faces and waving his arms, and then he put his hands behind his back, and
dancing a jig, headed down the slope. He was not looking at Redrick any more, he
had forgotten Redrick, he had forgotten everything. He was going down to make
his wishes come true, the little secret wishes of a blushing college student, of a
boy who had never seen any money beyond his allowance, who had been beaten
mercilessly if he had a whiff of alcohol on his breath when he came home, and
who was being groomed to be a famous lawyer, and in the future, a cabinet minister,
and in the distant future, and as his greatest prospect -- president. Redrick, squint-
ing his swollen eyes against the blinding light, silently watched him go. He was
cool and calm, he knew what was about to happen, and he knew that he would not
watch, but it was still all right to watch, and he did, feeling nothing in particular,
except that deep inside a little worm started wriggling around and twisting its
sharp head in his gut.
And the boy kept walking down, dancing a jig, shuffling to his own beat, and
the white dust rose from his heels, and he was shouting at the top of his lungs,
clearly, joyously, and festively -- either a song or an incantation -- and Redrick
thought that this was the first time in the history of the quarry that a man went
down there as though he were going to a party. And at first he did not listen to
what his talking key was yelling, and then something clicked inside him and he
heard:
"Happiness for everybody! ... Free! ... As much as you want! ... Everybody
come here! ... There’s enough for everybody! Nobody will leave unsatisfied! ...
Free! ... Happiness! ... Free!"
And then he was suddenly silent, as though a huge fist had punched him in the
mouth. And Redrick saw the transparent emptiness that was lurking in the shadow
of the excavator’s bucket grab him, throw him up in the air, and slowly slowly twist
him, like a housewife wringing her wash. Redrick had time to see one of his dusty
shoes fall off his jerking leg and fly high above the quarry. Then he turned away
and sat down. There wasn’t a single thought in his head, and he had somehow
stopped sensing himself. Silence hung heavy in the air, particularly behind him,
there on the road. Then he remembered the flask, without particular joy, but just
as medicine that it was time to take. He unscrewed the cap and drank with tiny
stingy sips, and for the first time in his life he wished that instead of liquor, the
flask contained cold water.
Time passed, and more or less coherent thoughts came to him. Well, that’s it,
he thought unwillingly. The road is open. He could go down right now, but it was
better, of course, to wait a while. The meatgrinders can be tricky. Anyway, he had
some thinking to do. An unaccustomed exercise, thinking, that was the trouble.
What was "thinking" anyway? Thinking meant finding a loophole, pulling a bluff,
pulling the wool over someone’s eyes -- but all that was out of place here.
All right. Monkey, his father... Make them pay for that, steal the bastards’ souls,
let the sons of bitches eat what I’ve been eating... No, that’s not it, Red... I mean,
that is it, but what does it mean? What do I need? That’s cursing, not thinking. A
terrible presentiment chilled him, and quickly skipping over the many arguments
that were still ahead of him, he told himself angrily: this is how it is, Red, you
won’t leave here until you figure it out, you’ll drop dead here next to the ball,
burn to death and rot, but you won’t leave.
God, where are the words, where are my thoughts? He slapped his head. I have
never had a thought in my entire life! Wait, wait, Kirill used to say something like
that. Kirill! He feverishly dug through his memories, and words floated to the
surface, familiar ones and unfamiliar, but it was all wrong, because Kirill had not
left words behind. He had left pictures, vague, and very kind, but thoroughly im-
probable.
Meanness and treachery. They let me down in this too, they left me speechless,
the bastards. A bum -- I was always a bum, and now I’m an old bum. It’s not right,
do you hear me? In the future, for once and for all, it should be outlawed! Man is
born in order to think (there he is, old Kirill at last!). Only I don’t believe it. I didn’t
believe it before and I don’t believe it now. And I don’t know what man is born
for. I was born. So here I am. People eat whatever they can. Let all of us be heal-
thy and let all of them drop dead. Who is us and who are they? I don’t understand
a thing. If I’m happy, Burbridge isn’t, if Burbridge’s happy, Four-eyes isn’t, if
Throaty is happy, no one else is, and if things are bad for Throaty, he’s the only
one fool enough to think he’ll manage somehow. God, it’s just one long brawl! I
